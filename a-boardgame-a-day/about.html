  <strong>What is A Board Game A Day?</strong>

<p>This blog is run by Hannah and John, a pair of avid board gamers. Between the two of us, we boast a collection of 80+ board games, including every edition of <em>Love Letter</em> released in the UK, every edition of <em>Tanto Cuore</em> and just about every edition of <em>Ticket To Ride</em>! One of our goals as a couple is to play at least one board game every day in 2018.</p>

<strong>That didn't answer the question...</strong>

<p>Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. Whilst we're playing at least one game each day in 2018, we're keeping tabs on stats such as most played game, what percentage of our played games are co-operative, how many times John completes wipes the floor with Hannah in almost every versus game. Once a month, we'll be providing graphs, stats and facts about the games played in that month. This blog is where we'll be doing this.</p>

<strong>Will you be doing any reviews?</strong>

<p>Never say never...</p>

<strong>Can I see what games you own?</strong>

<p>Sure, just head on over to Hannah's page on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/hannardynamite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BoardGameGeek</a>!</p>
